Appendix A – full smiServices set-up script 
 
First, download and unpack the RDMP and SmiServices tools from Github, along with Mongo and MySQL. What location on Github? 
 
Assumptions – substitute according to your own environment/choices: 
Everything underneath /imaging: 
/imaging/bin – storage for SMI and RDMP tools 
/imaging/conf – configuration files for SMI and RDMP 
/imaging/db – mount point for faster (SSD/RAID10) storage for databases 
/imaging/db/sql 
/imaging/db/mongo 
/imaging/data – main bulk storage area for DICOM files 
MySQL databases will be: smi smi_isolation 
RabbitMQ will be required if using the SMI extraction pipeline – we aren’t, so that isn’t yet documented here. These instructions currently deliver only the load/indexing stage. 
 
The script below will create appropriate tables, an smi user account in MySQL with access to them, and set RDMP up accordingly.  
 
TODO: 
Set up ExternalDatabaseServer for smi_isolation 
GuidDatabaseNamer for RAW/STAGING? 
 
 
 
Copy the file ‘default.yaml’ from the SMI distribution to /imaging/conf/smi.yaml and make the following changes: 
LogsRoot: ‘/imaging/logs’ 
FileSystemRoot: ‘/imaging’ 
ExtractRoot: ‘/imaging’ 
YamlDir: ‘/imaging/conf/rdmp’ 
LoadMetadataId: (ID from: ‘basename /imaging/conf/rdmp/LoadMetadata/* .yaml’)
